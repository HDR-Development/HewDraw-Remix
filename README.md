HewDraw Remix is a free to play fan-made modification of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. HDR is the largest and most ambitious overhaul for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate yet. Various techniques from previous Smash games are added to create a fresh experience that blends the design of the older games with the new, along with plenty of new moves and balance changes to keep the experience unique.
